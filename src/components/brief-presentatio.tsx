        With more than 4 years of professional experience, I've worked with a 
        variety of technologies, and I've been specializing more and more in the 
        frontend area, mainly with React, TypeScript, Tailwind and Jest.

        I currently spend time updating myself with new tools, best practices, 
        modern testing, and creating my own projects to regain fluency and 
        explore new ways to transform designs into efficient, accessible and 
        tasteful applications, writing more readable, maintainable and robust 
        code.
